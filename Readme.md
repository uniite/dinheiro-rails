# Dinheiro (Rails Frontend)
This application provides an alternate frontend for Dinheiro, a personal finance management app.

## Background
Whereas the original frontend was written in AngularJS as part of the Django project this frontend attempts to replace it with 
a regular Rails-templated UI, using turbolinks. The advantage is better performance with less effort,
as well as less development effort required on the client-side.

Normally, this would be a waste of resources at low-scale, but I have a scarcity of time to work on these projects,
so it was more effective for me to try it this way.
